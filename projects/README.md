## Projects

### ALARM-KAFKA-001: Enhanced Kafka Streams Error Handling

**Repository:** https://github.com/ControlSystemStudio/phoebus  
**Difficulty:** Advanced  
**Skills Required:** Java, Kafka Streams API, Error Handling Patterns  

**Description:**  
Implement robust error handling for Kafka Streams in alarm logger and alarm config logger services using the latest Kafka Streams API patterns. Currently, services can fail silently or terminate when encountering deserialization errors, malformed messages, transient Kafka issues, or missing/deleted topics.

- Add `StreamsUncaughtExceptionHandler` to all KafkaStreams instances in `AlarmMessageLogger`, `AlarmCmdLogger`, and `AlarmConfigLogger` to handle fatal errors and decide on stream continuation vs. shutdown
- Implement custom `DeserializationExceptionHandler` for handling corrupted messages without stopping the entire stream
- Add `ProductionExceptionHandler` for producer-side error handling
- Handle `MissingSourceTopicException` by logging the error, preventing service crash, and allowing retry logic to eventually reconnect when topics are created
- Log structured error information (message offset, partition, topic, error type) for debugging
- Implement graceful degradation: continue processing valid messages despite errors in other messages
- Add metrics/counters for error rates per error type (deserialization failures, missing topics, transient errors)
- Create unit tests with intentionally malformed Kafka messages and missing topic scenarios

**Resources:**
- Kafka Streams error handling: https://kafka.apache.org/41/documentation/streams/developer-guide/config-streams.html#default-deserialization-exception-handler

### ALARM-KAFKA-002: Resilient Topic Handling with Retry Logic

**Repository:** https://github.com/ControlSystemStudio/phoebus  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate  
**Skills Required:** Java, Kafka Admin API, Retry Patterns  

**Description:**  
Enhance alarm logger and alarm configuration logger services to gracefully handle missing or deleted Kafka topics with automatic retry logic. Currently, services fail on startup if topics don't exist.

- Modify `AlarmMessageLogger`, `AlarmCmdLogger`, and `AlarmConfigLogger` to catch topic-not-found exceptions on startup and during runtime
- Implement exponential backoff retry strategy (initial: 5s, max: 5min, backoff: 2x)
- Add periodic topic existence checks using Kafka `AdminClient` to verify topic availability
- Log messages about missing topics and retry attempts with countdown timers
- When topics appear, automatically initialize streams and resume processing without requiring service restart
- Ensure service remains running in degraded state during topic unavailability, providing health check endpoints that reflect the degraded status
- Add configuration properties for retry intervals and max retry attempts
- Services should recover automatically without restart when topics are recreated, reconnecting to Kafka and resuming message processing

### ALARM-REST-001: Alarm Configuration REST API

**Repository:** https://github.com/ControlSystemStudio/phoebus  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate  
**Skills Required:** Java, Spring Boot, REST API Design, Kafka  

**Description:**  
Create a REST API for the alarm configuration service that exposes read-only access to the current alarm tree configuration.

- Add REST controller to alarm-config-logger or create new alarm-config-service module
- Implement GET endpoints:
  - `/api/config/{root}` - Get entire alarm tree for configuration root
- Return the complete alarm config as xml (or json)
- Add OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Implement proper HTTP status codes (404 for missing nodes)

### ALARM-UI-001: Display High/Low Alarm Limits in Alarm Tree Tooltip

**Repository:** https://github.com/ControlSystemStudio/phoebus  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate  
**Skills Required:** JavaFX, EPICS PVA/PVAccess, Alarm System Architecture  

**Description:**  
Enhance the Phoebus alarm tree to display high and low alarm limits (HIHI, HIGH, LOW, LOLO) in the PV tooltip. This metadata is already available through tools like Probe but would be valuable context directly in the alarm tree view. The challenge is efficiently handling limit updates without reconnecting or making excessive PV reads.

- Add alarm limit fields to alarm tree tooltip display: HIHI, HIGH, LOW, LOLO thresholds
- Implement efficient limit value retrieval:
  - Read alarm limit fields during initial PV connection establishment
  - Use PV metadata subscription to detect limit changes without reconnecting
- Update `AlarmTreeItem` or equivalent model to cache limit values
- Handle cases where limits are not defined (NaN, or not applicable for non-numeric PVs)
- Consider performance implications: avoid reading limits for every PV on every tooltip hover
- Implement lazy loading: fetch limits on first tooltip request, cache for subsequent hovers
- Display limits with appropriate formatting and units in tooltip
- Add user preference to enable/disable limit display in tooltips
- Reference ISIS implementation for listener pattern approach

**Resources:**
- ISIS Computing Group implementation: https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/cs-studio/blob/master/applications/alarm/alarm-plugins/org.csstudio.alarm.beast/src/org/csstudio/alarm/beast/client/AlarmTreePV.java

### ALARM-UI-002: Improve Alarm Log Table Search/Query UI

**Repository:** https://github.com/ControlSystemStudio/phoebus  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate  
**Skills Required:** JavaFX, REST APIs, UI/UX Design  

**Description:**  
Redesign the alarm log table search interface to be more intuitive and user-friendly. Current query string is unnecessarily verbose (`pv=*&alarm_severity=*&alarm_message=*&pv_severity=*&pv_message=*&user=*&host=*&command=*&start=7 days&end=now`) and difficult to construct.

- Replace verbose query string with clean search form matching Logbook/Save & Restore UI patterns
- Only include non-default parameters in queries (omit `field=*` wildcards)
- Add intuitive controls: time range picker, severity dropdown, PV name field with autocomplete
- Add saved search templates for common queries
- Implement pagination or virtual scrolling for large result sets

**Resources:**
- `app/alarm/ui/src/main/java/org/phoebus/applications/alarm/ui/table/AlarmTableUI.java`
- Reference Logbook UI: `app/logbook/ui/`

**Repository:** https://github.com/ControlSystemStudio/phoebus  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate  
**Skills Required:** Java, Kafka Admin API, Refactoring  

**Description:**  
Refactor the alarm server's Kafka topic creation and configuration logic into a centralized utility class or service. Currently, topic management code is scattered across multiple locations (AlarmServerMain, AggregateTopics) with inconsistent patterns and configuration.

- Create a dedicated `KafkaTopicManager` service class in the alarm-server module
- Consolidate all topic creation logic from `AlarmServerMain` and `AggregateTopics` into the new service
- Implement consistent topic configuration (partitions, replication factor, retention, cleanup policy)
- Make topic attributes configurable via Phoebus preferences (replication factor, partitions, retention policy, backup settings)
- Implement topic validation and health checks (verify topic exists, check configuration matches expectations)
- Add logging for all topic operations with structured information
- Add unit tests with embedded Kafka or mock AdminClient
- Update `AlarmServerMain` and `AggregateTopics` to use the new service

**Resources:**
- Kafka AdminClient API: https://kafka.apache.org/41/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/AdminClient.html
- Topic configuration: https://kafka.apache.org/41/documentation.html#topicconfigs

### PHOEBUS-UI-001: Fix TimeRangePopover Relative Time Selection

**Repository:** https://github.com/ControlSystemStudio/phoebus  
**Difficulty:** Beginner  
**Skills Required:** JavaFX, UI/UX, Time Handling  

**Description:**  
Fix inconsistent behavior in the TimeRangePopover's relative time selection controls, specifically in the TimeRelativeIntervalPane. The current implementation has confusing increment/decrement behavior, especially with months and edge cases when values reach zero.

- Analyze current behavior in `TimeRelativeIntervalPane` for relative time field adjustments
- Fix decrement behavior: when days field is 0 and decremented, it goes to 31 days (should handle more predictably)
- Fix increment behavior: incrementing days from 31 goes to 32 (months conversion logic is broken)
- Consider simplifying by removing "months" field entirely (months are inconsistent time units: 28-31 days)
- Implement consistent rollover behavior for time unit boundaries
- Add validation to prevent invalid intermediate states
- Add unit tests for edge cases and boundary conditions
- Test with Data Browser and other tools that use TimeRangePopover

**Repository:** https://github.com/ControlSystemStudio/phoebus  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate  
**Skills Required:** JavaFX, Data Browser Architecture, Archive Appliance Integration  

**Description:**  
Add UI functionality to manually add, remove, and modify archive data sources in the Data Browser. Currently, the Data Browser automatically removes inaccessible data sources (good for preventing unnecessary calls), but there's no way to re-add them after an archiver recovers from a temporary outage. This feature existed in legacy CS-Studio and is needed for operational flexibility.
- Add context menu actions in Properties -> Traces -> Archive view:
  - "Add Archive Data Source" - add from configured preferences
  - "Remove Archive Data Source" - remove selected source
  - "Refresh Data Source" - retry connection to disabled source
- Show data source health status in archive view (active, disabled, error with timestamp)??
- Persist manual data source changes in Data Browser configuration files
- Update Data Browser to respect manually added sources even if initially unreachable??

**Resources:**
- Legacy CS-Studio archive preferences for reference
